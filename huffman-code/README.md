## 📜 Description ##

Write two programs:

- One program to read a file and calculate entropy (Shannon) of file;
- One program to read a file and generate a compressed file using Huffman codification.

### 🛠️ Instructions ###

Make this following experiment:

1. Choose at least 4 (four) files of different types;
2. Compress they using Huffman.
3. Calculate the entropy of original files of the compressed ones;

The 4 (four) files would be:

1. HTML Document in Natural Language;
2. Compressed ZIP file;
3. Cyphered File (with, like, PGP);
4. Other file type is of your choice.

## 📄 Write a small report ##

The Report would compare the entropy of the files, before and after compress.
